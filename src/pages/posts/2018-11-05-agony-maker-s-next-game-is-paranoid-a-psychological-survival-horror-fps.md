Madmind Studios announced today its next title, a survival-horror FPS that looks to be every bit as nightmarish as its predecessor, Agony, which released in May 2018. 

Instead of spelunking the depths of hell with the subtlety of a jackhammer, Paranoid takes a psychological horror angle with themes of grief, seclusion, and drug abuse. 

These topics require a more nuanced touch that Madmind frankly did not display with Agony, which Waypoint's Patrick Klepek [described](https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/3k45an/agony-a-game-about-dehumanizing-women-isnt-just-bad-its-toxic) as "a mixture of what you might find in a horny teenagerâ€™s sketchbook crossed with an angry YouTuber screaming about how feminists have come to destroy their video games."

Paranoid follows the story of Patrick Calman, a 31-year old man who lost his family under mysterious circumstances. The sense of [ambiguous loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous_loss) that descends upon Calman drives him into seclusion for many years, until he receives a call from his missing sister - long presumed dead.

To learn the truth, he must venture out into the world and contend with paranoia, drug abuse, and a blurred line between paranoia and reality. Let's hope the line between entertainment and objectification isn't so blurry this time around.
