Indie rogue-lite _Moonlighter_ has enjoyed a strong reception since its release in May 2018, and today it's available globally on PlayStation 4 and Switch for $30 and $35, respectively.

Published by [11bit Studios](http://www.11bitstudios.com/) and developed by [Digital Sun](http://www.digitalsungames.com/), _Moonlighter_ follows the double life of shopkeeper Will, who tends to his shop in Rynoka Village by day, and hunts monsters by night to collect wares. 

A potent mix of management sim and action RPG, _Moonlighter_ improves upon "that wonderful gameplay loop that _Stardew Valley_ excels at," writes [GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/moonlighter-review/). 

Also available for PS4 and Switch is a new Signature Edition ($50), which includes the following extras:

* A region free copy of the 'Moonlighter' game
* A CD digipak soundtrack
* A squishy jelly-monster figure
* An exclusive Moonlighter medallion with string
* A3 game poster featuring developer's digitally printed signatures
* A sturdy "Sierra"-style Signature Edition box
* An outer sleeve with bespoke artwork and featuring the developer's digitally printed signatures

 _Moonlighter_ is also available for Xbox One, PC, Mac, and Linux.
