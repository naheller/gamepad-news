Finnish developer Animera Games today announced its debut game, _Shakes on a Plane_, launching first on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/964620/Shakes_on_a_Plane/) in Q3 2019. Consoles versions will follow later.

Inspired by couch co-op games like _Overcooked_, _Shakes on a Plane_ is a physics-based time management game that puts players on the other side of the aisle - as airline crew members. Each player has a role to fill, whether it's cooking, serving food, cleaning trash, or even handing out vomit bags.

In the event of an emergency, crew members are also responsible for preparing passengers for a paradrop. What happens if that goes wrong? We'll have to wait and see.

Each playable character in _Shakes on a Plane_ has its own personality and special abilities, which adds another element of specialization into the mix. The game is best played with 2-4 crew members, but it also features a single-player mode.

Animera Games is a subsidiary of Satapro, which is a multidisciplinary cooperative for creative folk like filmmakers and photographers. _Shakes on a Plane_ is Animera's first project. Let's hope for a smooth takeoff!
