_Kenshi_, the post-apocalyptic samurai RPG from Lo-Fi Games, will release on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/) next month, December 6, after 12 years of development.

Chris Hunt founded Lo-Fi Games as a one-man team in 2008, funding his passion project by working as a security guard at night. After getting _Kenshi_ onto Steam Greenlight in 2014, he was able to put together a team and start building momentum in earnest. 

Today, Lo-Fi has finally entered the home stretch, with four full-timers and over 30 freelancers and volunteers contributing.

_Kenshi_ is an esoteric mix of RPG elements, squad-based control, and city-building features. It features a post-apocalyptic world of cannibals, bandits, slavers, beasts, and you, the player. 

Hunt makes it abundantly clear that you are _not_ the chosen one: "What I really love in a game is when you can take a nameless, weak character under your wing and train them up until they’re the strongest character you have," he says. 

Beyond the player, the options seem to expand out infinitely: base-building, squad-based gameplay, a realistic medical system, factions, mods, and the "largest RPG world since Daggerfall."

This all sounds like a tall order for such a small team, but patience and persistence may have paid out, with over 5,000 Steam reviews averaging "Very Positive" during _Kenshi_'s early access period.

_Kenshi_ will release on Steam for all countries for $30 (£23 / €27 / ¥3500) on Thursday, December 6, 2018.
