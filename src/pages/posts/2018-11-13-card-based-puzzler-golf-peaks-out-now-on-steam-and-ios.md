Two-man developer Afterburn makes a swing for mobile golf gamers with the release of _Golf Peaks_, a card-based puzzler that's perfect for one-handed play.

_Golf Peaks_ is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/923260/Golf_Peaks/) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/golf-peaks/id1419542293), as well as on [itch.io](https://afterburn.itch.io/golf-peaks), the open marketplace for indie developers. The game is currently on sale for $4.49 (down from $4.99) on PC, and at its regular price of $2.99 on iOS.

_Golf Peaks_ was developed by a small team in Poland over the course of five months. In their words: "Golf served both as an inspiration and as "glue" that binds the game’s mechanics, even though none of us had any prior experience with actual golf."

Although this is Afterburn's first project, their Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/afterburngames/about/) mentions that the team includes developers who worked on _SUPERHOT_ and _Gwent: The Witcher Card Game_, so there's some solid, multi-genre experience under the hood.

We're looking forward to putting, chipping, and driving through the game's 70+ levels on our daily commute, even if we're not exactly sure what some of those words mean.
