Look for _Ark: Survival Evolved_'s latest expansion, _Extinction_, on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/887380/ARK_Extinction__Expansion_Pack/) today as it goes live for $20. The game's third expansion takes players back to a ruined Earth where they'll contend with dungeon dwelling creatures called Titans.

Players will be able to transfer characters from other servers into _Extinction_, however items and tames will have to stay behind. On the flip side, anything created or earned in an _Extinction_ server can be safely transferred out.

North American and European servers (70-player cap) will be introduced first, and _Extinction_ will be included in all CrossARK clusters, as well as Conquest and Small Tribes servers.

Some notable new features include new mutated creatures to tame, creature-popping Cryopods, defensible Orbital Supply Drops, aerial item balloons, extendable Tek Bridges, and of course those massive, roaming Titans.

Console players can expect _Extinction_ to release on PS4 and Xbox One on November 13. The game is included in _Ark_'s season pass, but can be purchased separately as well.

The PC version of _Ark: Survival Evolved_ will be free-to-play on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346110/ARK_Survival_Evolved/) through November 11, and discounted to $20 through November 13.
