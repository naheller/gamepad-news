Little Beavers Games announced today their first game, _Creatures Inc_, which will launch on Steam Early Access on January 22, 2019.

The third-person shooter combines management and action, where your goal is to run a creature hunting company and pursue clients' contracts.

The [teaser video](https://youtu.be/laCdkZdfgi4) shows frenetic action sequences where the player is tasked with taming creatures, saving civilians, and finding their way back home safely.

Tamed creatures may also be taken along on future missions as fighting minions, which could make for interesting group compositions in addition to weapon choices.

Although multiplayer monster hunting has not yet been mentioned, we are told that players will be able to "connect with \[their] friends" (see press release) to trade weapons, creatures, accessories, and weapon textures.

Languages options for _Creatures Inc_ will include English, Simplified Chinese, German, French, Spanish, Russian, and Portuguese.
